# LockPick
WIT Software Engineering Project

Lockpick shall allow users to:
•	Manage accounts
•	Add/delete username and password information per account
•	Reset PIN if forgotten

This software's goal is to help organize all of the family logins and passwords into one single software. There is one account used to log into LockPick, which then
prompts you to select one of the profiles for each user on the account. Once an account is select, the user enters there 6-digit pin and will have access to all their
logins along with all the public logins for shared services like video and music streaming apps. You also have the option to integrate the software into other 
applications so instead of manually putting in your password once you check it, user will be prompted to enter their 6-digit pin and their login will automatically be 
input and signed-in to which app or website they're using.
